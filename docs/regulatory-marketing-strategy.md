# Regulatory Marketing Strategy: EU Waste Reduction Targets

## Strategic Marketing Advantage

The EU 30% waste reduction target represents a **powerful and legally defensible marketing position** that creates urgency and inevitability around restaurant waste reduction efforts.

## Key Marketing Messages (Legally Validated)

- Creates sense of urgency and inevitability
- Positions early adoption as competitive advantage
- Frames waste reduction as compliance necessity, not optional sustainability

### 2. National Policy Cascade Effect

**Marketing Power**:
- Explains the practical impact on individual businesses

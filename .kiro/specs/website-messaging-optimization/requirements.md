# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the Verkflöde website messaging from philosophical storytelling to direct, business-focused value propositions. The goal is to address immediate customer pain points (profitability, compliance, brand reputation) with concrete benefits, specific metrics, and regulatory urgency to drive faster purchase decisions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a food service executive visiting the website, I want to immediately understand the concrete business benefits and ROI, so that I can quickly assess if this solution addresses my urgent operational challenges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor lands on the homepage THEN the hero headline SHALL prominently display "Turn Food Waste Into Profit and Compliance" as the primary value proposition
2. WHEN a visitor reads the hero section THEN they SHALL see the specific "7:1 return on investment" statistic within the first 100 words
3. WHEN a visitor scans the hero content THEN they SHALL understand the three core benefits: eliminate food waste, automate EU reporting, and achieve ROI within 15 seconds
4. WHEN a visitor reads the subheadline THEN it SHALL clearly state what the product does ("eliminate food waste," "automate reporting") rather than abstract concepts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a restaurant owner concerned about EU regulations, I want to understand the urgent compliance requirements and how this solution addresses them, so that I can make an informed decision about regulatory risk.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor reads the problem section THEN the heading SHALL be "An Urgent Operational Challenge" instead of "A Crisis of Imagination"
2. WHEN a visitor reads about the problem THEN they SHALL see specific mention of "Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)" within the first paragraph
3. WHEN a visitor learns about the problem THEN they SHALL understand that "inaction is no longer an option" due to mandatory audited disclosures
4. WHEN a visitor reads the problem description THEN it SHALL frame food waste as a "direct hit to your bottom line" and "critical business issue"
5. WHEN a visitor sees the statistics THEN they SHALL include concrete metrics like "30-50% waste reduction" and "€7 saved for every €1 invested"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business decision-maker, I want to see specific, measurable outcomes and regulatory compliance details, so that I can justify the investment to stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor reads the three-goal mission THEN each goal SHALL include specific, quantifiable metrics
2. WHEN a visitor sees Goal 1 THEN it SHALL state "Cut Food Costs & CO2 Emissions" with "30-50% waste reduction within a year"
3. WHEN a visitor sees Goal 2 THEN it SHALL mention "ESRS E5 (Resource Use and Circular Economy)" specifically
4. WHEN a visitor sees Goal 3 THEN it SHALL state "7:1 Financial Return" with "Most businesses recoup their investment in the first year"
5. WHEN a visitor reads compliance information THEN they SHALL see "granular, auditable data" and "streamlined process" language

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a smaller restaurant that isn't directly regulated by CSRD, I want to understand why this solution is still essential for my business, so that I don't dismiss it as irrelevant to my size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor reads the website THEN there SHALL be a new section titled "Secure Your Place in the Sustainable Supply Chain"
2. WHEN a visitor reads this section THEN they SHALL understand that large corporations must report on their "entire value chain—including their suppliers"
3. WHEN a visitor learns about supply chain requirements THEN they SHALL see that hotels, caterers, and food service groups will require sustainability data from restaurant partners
4. WHEN a visitor understands the value chain effect THEN they SHALL see Verkflöde positioned as making them "a preferred supplier"

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a potential customer evaluating timing, I want to understand the converging market forces creating urgency, so that I can prioritize this investment appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor reads the website THEN there SHALL be a new section titled "The Market Has Changed. Your Tools Should Too."
2. WHEN a visitor reads about market forces THEN they SHALL see three specific drivers: Binding Regulation, Consumer Demand, and Economic Pressure
3. WHEN a visitor learns about regulation THEN they SHALL see "CSRD and the EU's new targets to slash restaurant food waste by 30% by 2030 are now law"
4. WHEN a visitor reads about consumer demand THEN they SHALL see "90% of consumers say sustainability matters" statistic
5. WHEN a visitor understands economic pressure THEN they SHALL see "eliminating waste is one of the most effective ways to protect your profit margins"

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the philosophical "crisis of imagination" messaging preserved in an appropriate context, so that the brand story isn't completely lost while making the homepage more business-focused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the homepage is updated THEN the "crisis of imagination" concept SHALL be moved to the About page or a brand story section
2. WHEN a visitor wants to learn about company philosophy THEN they SHALL be able to find the original messaging in a dedicated brand/story context
3. WHEN the homepage focuses on business benefits THEN it SHALL maintain the Swedish innovation and collective intelligence positioning
4. WHEN visitors navigate to brand content THEN they SHALL still experience the inspirational messaging about transforming imagination into action

## Components and Interfaces

### Hero Section Redesign
```html
<!-- New Hero Structure -->
<section class="hero-section">
  <h1>Turn Food Waste Into Profit and Compliance</h1>
  <p>Verkflöde's Collective Intelligence platform empowers your kitchen to eliminate food waste, automate EU sustainability reporting, and achieve a 7:1 return on investment.</p>
  <div class="hero-stats">
    <span>7:1 ROI</span>
    <span>30-50% Waste Reduction</span>
    <span>CSRD Compliant</span>
  </div>
</section>
```

### Problem Section Transformation
```html
<!-- Updated Problem Section -->
<section id="problem">
  <h2>An Urgent Operational Challenge</h2>
  <p>Across Europe, food waste is a critical business issue. It represents not only a significant environmental impact—with every kilogram of waste generating 2.5 kg of CO2—but also a direct hit to your bottom line. With the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) now mandating audited disclosures on waste, inaction is no longer an option.</p>
</section>
```

### Enhanced Mission Section
```html
<!-- Quantified Mission Goals -->
<div class="mission-goals">
  <div class="goal">
    <h3>Cut Food Costs & CO2 Emissions</h3>
    <p>Turn waste into a revenue opportunity. Our clients typically reduce food waste by 30-50% within a year, directly lowering procurement costs.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="goal">
    <h3>Automate CSRD & ESRS E5 Reporting</h3>
    <p>Go beyond estimates. Our platform provides the granular, auditable data required for ESRS E5 (Resource Use and Circular Economy), turning a complex compliance burden into a streamlined process.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="goal">
    <h3>Achieve a 7:1 Financial Return</h3>
    <p>Invest with confidence. For every €1 invested in food waste reduction, restaurants save an average of €7 in operating costs. Most businesses recoup their investment in the first year.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

### New Supply Chain Section
```html
<!-- New Supply Chain Value Section -->
<section id="supply-chain">
  <h2>Secure Your Place in the Sustainable Supply Chain</h2>
  <p>The CSRD requires large corporations to report on their entire value chain—including their suppliers. This means that hotels, caterers, and food service groups will require accurate sustainability data from their restaurant partners to remain compliant. Verkflöde makes you a preferred supplier by providing the verifiable data your largest customers now demand.</p>
</section>
```

### New Market Urgency Section
```html
<!-- New Market Forces Section -->
<section id="market-urgency">
  <h2>The Market Has Changed. Your Tools Should Too.</h2>
  <div class="market-forces">
    <div class="force">
      <h3>Binding Regulation</h3>
      <p>The CSRD and the EU's new targets to slash restaurant food waste by 30% by 2030 are now law.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="force">
      <h3>Consumer Demand</h3>
      <p>90% of consumers say sustainability matters, and a majority state it influences their dining choices. Transparent, data-backed sustainability is key to building brand loyalty.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="force">
      <h3>Economic Pressure</h3>
      <p>With rising food costs, eliminating waste is one of the most effective ways to protect your profit margins.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

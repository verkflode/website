# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a Swedish-language version of the Verkflöde website with localized crisis messaging that leverages Sweden's missed 2025 food waste targets and connects them to incoming EU regulatory requirements. The approach combines emotional urgency (Swedish failure) with regulatory urgency (CSRD mandate) to create maximum market penetration in the Swedish launch market while maintaining the existing English business-focused messaging for international audiences.

## Requirements
